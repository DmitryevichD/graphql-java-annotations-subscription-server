# GraphQL Java Annotations Subscription Server
This is a (not so) pretty implementation of a graphql server using Spring Boot & GraphQL-Java-Annotations library.
It also implements a GraphQL Subscription using graphql-java v7.0 & Websocket, according to the graphql-ws protocol.
You are welcome to take some inspiration from the subscription-usages.
